        <ol>
            <li>Prepare your pizza dough ahead of time. 
            Our guide to making the perfect Classic Pizza Dough covers everything you need to know.</li>
            <li>For the sauce for this pizza, we recommend preparing our easy Classic Pizza Sauce. 
            With a hint of garlic, salt and basil, 
            it's the ideal pizza sauce that will help to bring out the flavours in the other ingredients used here.</li>
            <li>Fire up your Ooni pizza oven. 
            Aim for 500˚C (932˚F) on the stone baking board inside. 
            You can check the temperature inside your oven quickly and easily using the Ooni Infrared Thermometer.</li>
            <li>Using a small amount of flour, dust your Ooni pizza peel. 
            Stretch the pizza dough ball out to 12"/16" and lay it out on your pizza peel. 
            Top with the mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Slide the pizza off the peel and into your Ooni pizza oven, 
            making sure to rotate the pizza regularly.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the pizza from the oven and top with whole, fresh basil leaves. Serve immediately</li>
